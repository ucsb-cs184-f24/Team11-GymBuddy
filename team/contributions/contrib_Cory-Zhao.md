Over this course, my contributions have been spread out around this app. My first task was the analytic charts. I built the component, helper functions, UI, etc.

For the MVP, I helped with the profile page. I helped build the UI, design, etc.

For HW4, my main contribution was the design of our new feature which was the social media aspect of this app. I designed the UI, what parts we wanted: following, followers, posts, comments, etc. Furthermore, I designed the structure of the database and also implemented the backend of the users portion of the database.

Now, I have mainly been doing whatever task is needed. I've cleaned up a bunch of frontend code and have been working on small bug fixes.
