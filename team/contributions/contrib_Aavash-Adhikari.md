My main contributions to this application were the stats page, the initial framework for the workout page, and the basic user experience and bug fixes. 
I recently implemented the stats page that shows your workout analytics including the number of workouts throughout the week, month, and year as well as
what body parts you worked out on any given day. Additionally, I added a leaderboard that displays how many workouts everyone on the app has. Right now, it just sorts by who has completed the most workouts, but in the future I would make it so that it sorts by who has the most weight for a given workout. For example, filter by benchpress and then whoever has the highest bench press would be first on the leaderboard.
I also did the initial framework for the workout page which allows you to create new workouts and choose
what workout you want to do filtered by body part(i.e. "Biceps" -> "curls", "hammer curls", etc.). You then chose how many sets of each workout you completed
and how many reps in each set. Aaron eventually reworked this page, but the filter and workout functionality remain unchanged. The main changes were an overhauled 
UI and integration to the home page where a new workout from the workout page would also be displayed on the home page. I also did a few bug fixes with the
keyboard where you could not tap out of the keyboard without pressing "return". However, I think that someone else's pull request that also fixed this got merged
before mine did. I also added haptic feedback, which enhanced the user experience by offering basic user feedback whenever a button is pressed.
