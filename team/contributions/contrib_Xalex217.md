Over the course of the project I made many contributions to the front end and UI of the app. I made the original home page, however we never ended up using my iteration. I also made a visual to be paired with the home page, but due to the use of a different home page, it never got fully implemented. I also made a massive overhaul to the workout page, doing a UI change so that the user can add weight, sets, and reps. It also would show when someone actually had a workout selected, and the workouts were listed out. I also made the original search bar, so that the user can find other people's accounts via username or first or last name.
