My main contribution towards the project has been the database. At first the database was a Firebase Realtime Database. I created the database, structure and functions to use towards the frontend for this. Later, we descided to switch to Firebase Firestore. I set this database up as well as well as making most of the service file functions.

These aspects may be underrepresented in the github commits.

I also worked fixing bugs:
- Blank Screen
- Duplicate Key error

I added a loading animation for the home screen

I created the frontend (and backend) for adding friends through the search page.

I added a refresh function for the home and workout page by swiping down on the list.
