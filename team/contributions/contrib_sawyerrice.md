Over the course of the project, my main contributions have been focused in on the profile page. I created the original draft of the page, and the first functionality with the page simply displaying name, email, and showing a profile picture. I gradually added pieces to this page, such as the ability to select a profile picture from your camera roll.

More recently, I worked on friend adding functionality to the profile page. This includes the ability to accept and deny friend requests, and the ability to see your current list of followers and following users. This further involved getting an accurate number of following and follower requests from the database. 

Further, leading up to the MVP deadlilne, I spent a significant amount of time modifying our UI to be more intuitive and cohesive.

During the week of November 24, I had significantly less commits as I was assigned evaluation for HW 4, and my work for HW 4 did not involve coding, but rather focused on in person data collection and interviews.
