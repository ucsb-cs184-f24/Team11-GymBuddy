Over the course of the project, my main contributions have been focused in on the profile page. I created the original draft of the page, and the first functionality with the page simply displaying name, email, and showing a profile picture. I gradually added pieces to this page, such as the ability to select a profile picture from your camera roll.

More recently, I worked on adding friend functionality to the profile page. This includes the ability to accept and deny friend requests, and the ability to see your current list of followers and following users.

Further, leading up to the MVP deadlilne, I spent a significant amount of time modifying our UI to be more intuitive and cohesive.
