# Planning
Cory and Chris will be designing the UI, backend, and database. We will present the design document and create workflows and steps to take.

# Implementation Goals 
Tyler C (Evaluation)- I am planning on designing a testing system so we can make sure the database is getting updated correctly as well as the correct pop ups showing up or posts appearing as they should with the correct information. 


Sawyer Rice (Evaluation) - I will be testing the image upload functionality of the database, as well as the analytics page accuracy. Both of these areas of our application currently have known bugs, and I will be looking to find the situations in which they arise.

Aaron Rosales (Implementation) - I will be working on making the add workout button for the homepage, as well as uploading a visual for our home page. 

Aavash Adhikari (Implementation) - I will be debugging our code specifically the keyboard bugs as well as implementing haptic feedback for the buttons on our app.

Liam Ronarch (Implementation) - I will be working on integrating new features with our updated database. This will include real time udating of posts, profile pictures, and adding friends.
