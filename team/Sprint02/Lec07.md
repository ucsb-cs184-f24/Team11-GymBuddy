The majority of the team is still working on getting HW2 finished up. Decided that we needed to find some time to work on the actual app and get some issues completed. We chose the Navbar as a key starting feature we should make and then it will be easier to design the pages from there. Working on figuring out which pairs will end up working on which sections.
