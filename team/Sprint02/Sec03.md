Aavash Adhikari is not present but still participating. All other members are present. 

Currently members are working on trying to get different types of OAuth to work. Firebase is currently being used to make local accounts, 
but members are working on individual ways to get Google OAuth to work. Mac users are experiencing slightly more success. Cory and Tyler

Whole team is working on Retro01.
