#Starting Point

The code initially had installation bugs and keyboard bugs as well as no textile feedback.

#Contributions

I fixed the keyboard bugs and figured out the root of the installation bug as well as added haptic feedback to all buttons on our app. I am also working on implementing the stats page but haven't pushed any changes yet as this was a last-minute pivot after completing what I set out to do.

#AffectedFiles
Because this is user experience related, there will be no difference in the pictures of our app but if you navigate to AA-keyboardJitterBUG and AA-HapticFeedback you can test out these features for yourself:
