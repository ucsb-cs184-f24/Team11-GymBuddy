postStructure.png is an image of the current post structure in our app. excercise.png represents the excercise option for posting, where each post is an individual excercise of a defined number of reps and sets. workout.png is meant to model a complete workout, thus a list of multiple different excercises each with its own rep and sets counts. These were the two different approaches we were deciding between for our post structure.

Ultimately, based on in person interviews/questioning, I have found that a majority of users would prefer a workout centric posting scheme. This allows users to make a singular post for an entire workout. The post would be large, but would include every single excercise within the workout, the reps, sets, and weights of each excercise, and an overall description or summary of the workout as a whole.
