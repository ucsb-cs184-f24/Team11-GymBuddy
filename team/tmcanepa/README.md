## Unit Testing
The test folder I created has the files that I tested as well as the test files I created and used to test the code. These are the files that I ran the unit testing on and were used to figure out what issues we might have with our original code and files.

## User Evaluation
The HW04 Evaluation Feedback Image is the results of my findings after interviewing my soccer team. I made use of converting my results into a bar chart, seperated by color so it made it much easier to visualize the findings. I also tracked some of the comments that people made as to give further information into what people wanted to see or liked. It also has comments about what posting style people liked.
