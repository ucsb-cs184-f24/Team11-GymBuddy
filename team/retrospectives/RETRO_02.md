# Date of Retrospective: 11/12/2024

* Led by: Aaron Rosales
* Present: All members present

## Action Item 
* Goal: Try to get individual work done earlier, so that multiple people can test it and merge everything together.
* Change: We will set a soft deadline two days before the actual deadline.
* Measurement: We can measure this by actually getting our work done two days prior.

  ## Additional notes
  * We have a somewhat buggy app so we want to start smoothening those kinks out.
 
  ## Retro Assessment
  * The experiment is kind of working out. We didn't quite hit the two-day mark as we had hoped, but we weren't cramming everything in at the last second either.
