## Action item

* a goal: Getting more organized with roles and figuring out exactaly what we need to be working on
* a change: We need to communicate with each other more about what is going on and how to divide tasks
* a measurement: We can measure the effect by seeing f the slack page is more active and if we are able to get any of the issues finished up because we play to work on them in pairs which will require more coounication

## Optional

* Notes: At this point we have almost nothing started for the app so it would be great to see that we have made a significant jump in progress by the next retro
