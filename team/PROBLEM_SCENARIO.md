The app idea is to create a place where you can document your gym progress and activities. For example, it will keep track of data such as when and where you go to the gym, what exercises you do, parts of the body that is being exercised, etc.

Further iterations will add more fun ways to express your gym progress. Maybe a visual of a human body where parts are filled in when you work out that part. Also, people having their own profiles and being able to friend other accounts and share their progress.

The problem this app solves is making tracking gym progress more easy and fun.
