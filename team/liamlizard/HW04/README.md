# Starting Point

The starting point is best described by looking at the previous photos that are contained within the Team11-GymBuddy/team/liamlizard folder. This documents what our app looked like before my changes. There was no profile page which would show posts and no way to edit a user's profile information.

# Contributions

The contributions are best shown looking at the two png files within this folder. There is now a profile page that has the ability to contain posts and an edit profile page which lets users change their information.
