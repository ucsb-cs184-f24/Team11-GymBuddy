# Starting Point

The starting point is best described by looking at the previous photos that are contained within the Team11-GymBuddy/team/liamlizard folder. This documents what our app looked like before my changes. There was no profile page which would show posts and no way to edit a user's profile information.

# Contributions

The contributions are best shown looking at the two png files within this folder. There is now a profile page that has the ability to contain posts and an edit profile page which lets users change their information. 

# Affected Code

The code has not been pushed to main so I will link all the files that I changed in my branch (LR-profile) below.

https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f24/Team11-GymBuddy/tree/LR-profile/project/components

Everything in these folders expect what is in components/Profile was I contribution I made.
