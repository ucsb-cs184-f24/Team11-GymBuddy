# Product Purpose 

We wanted to create an application that functions simultaneously as a workout tracker and a social media to post workouts. For right now we are focusing on gym based weightlifting workouts. The workout tracker will allow for users to store their workouts and ideally see themselves improving in the gym such that they will continue to be motivated to continue going to the gym. The social media aspect will ideally be a positive environment in which users will be able to see their friends workouts to show support as well as 'fitness influencer's' workouts in order to adapt their training plans. 

# Intended User Audience

This app is designed to create a social media experience centered around workouts. It aims to foster connections among individuals who enjoy fitness, particularly those who:

Transition from team sports and miss the camaraderie and encouragement of group workouts.
Are looking to make new friends with similar fitness goals.
The app provides a platform to track progress, share workout details, and motivate others within a supportive fitness community.
